""  i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in  their own time .  on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap .  the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me  across the yard thirty times and won every time .  the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had  such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot  approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a  space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our  imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with .  our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to  make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and  cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i  thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my  children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination  to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and  giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been .  i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a  bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t  talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used  when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary .  i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools .  i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my  daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning .  most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it  comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or  reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people ,  computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have  imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but  children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school .  when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me  and say , "" dad , i ' m bored . ""  "" go find something to do , "" i ' d reply .  "" i don ' t know what to do . ""  "" go outside and find a friend . ""  "" naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . ""  "" use your imagination . ""  "" huh ? "" he asked .  "" well , when i was young . . . "" you know the routine .  sports is the same . we ' re entertained for hours watching  someone else have fun doing what they ' re good at . wouldn ' t it be  better to be playing yourself ? if we don ' t like the sports available  to watch , we create new ones . it doesn ' t matter what , people will  pay to see it , because they need to be entertained . i haven ' t heard  of world championship worm digging , but if someone offered a large  cash price , people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants .  i worry . are we becoming a society that needs outside influence  to have fun ?  i think i ' ll go climb a tree .  maybe there ' s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is  attacking my castle .  just imagine .  - - michael t . smith  michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son .  from our mailbag :  ( in response to last week ' s story , cinderella men )  dear heartwarmers :  last week ' s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane . i  too , was born in the 30 s and felt some of the poverty of that time .  i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that  was so ever present in their lives . we were very fortunate in as  much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter . we had a  garden and salvaged every edible product available - - even certain  "" weeds "" that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in  them . i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i  wore with pride ! we were very poor , but so rich indeed because we  had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives , and  it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books . i  deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught  me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of  prosperity and promise . thank you again for your lovely story . god  bless .  - -  do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

( popt ) and roxxy corporation announced that the  companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby roxxy corporation will  acquire a 66 % interest in pop 3 ' s wholly owned subsidiary , viastar  distribution group , inc . "" vdg , "" forming a revolutionary new music company ,  controversial entertainment corporation . the transaction , consisting of  stock and cash , when completed , will provide pop 3 ' s shareholders with a  33 % stake in the new company .  roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los  angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment  corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and  execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder  approval immediately thereafter .  pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , "" this alliance will allow pop 3 to  achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music  industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they  create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers  access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . ""  roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives  drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house  producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry  today .  "" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major  labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that  cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million  selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell  hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists  that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , ""  stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .  "" additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability  to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail  location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net  profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our  artists . ""  mr . shebanow concluded , "" while there are smaller labels that do provide  a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources  to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have  on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great  producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the  customer that controversial entertainment will possess .

' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications  administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .  global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing  educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback  clause . the state of  california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular  classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful  bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities  portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the  originating school district . this process saves school districts  valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may  have access to future business for up to five years , depending on  the term of the piggyback contract .  the strategic focus on california schools  since 1998 ,  california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new  classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .  there are five compelling reasons for this trend :  modular  classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )  they cost  significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )  they offer  greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings  they are easier  to finance  they provide  financing incentives  to cope with population growth , the state department of  education estimates that  california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the  next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout  the california education sector , public and private schools are  expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their  additional classroom requirements over the next four years .  the california schools budget crisis  on  november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond  proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by  california  voters .  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school  districts throughout the state .  a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the  voters on the march 2004 .  these bond measures are about three times higher than the  record $ 9 . 2 billion bond  california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these  bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular  classroom construction and renovations .  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and  private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning  throughout  california .  gdvi business infrastructure  among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,  state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes  equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are  specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular  structures .  gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking  to add to its workforce as demand increases .  operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square  foot operating structure .  wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,  designs and manufactures the buildings  wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles  installation and building renovation .  symbol otc . bb  gdvi  recent price 13 . 5 cents  management team  philip hamilton , ceo and president  mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful  background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served  as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this  company from inception into one of  californias  largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools  and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter  industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater ,  california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the  company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales  of $ 50 , 000 , 000 .  adam de bard , vice president  mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the  manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as  vice president and chief  information officer of pacesetter industries .  ronald kilpatrick , director of finance  mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic  and international development and management of major corporations .  he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides  venture capital to projects in the  pacific rim .  recent headlines  global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to  increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility  pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new  order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery  pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 )  wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi  and geoi  pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 )  wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle  pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 )  global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets  from california modular company  pr newswire ( thu , may 26 )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division  implementing its fourth production line  pr newswire ( thu , may 19 )  talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton ,  president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc .  primezone media network ( tue , may 17 )  stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified  industries , inc .  primezone media network ( mon , may 16 )  global diversified industries ' modular division billings total  $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

this is critical  to your success .  take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do  not make any other changes .  save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with  marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with  invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where  to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to  get this venture going :  method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you  and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing  receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets  just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails  instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .  continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response ,  that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e -  mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with  orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .  those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 %  response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .  those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the  0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .  those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e -  mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .  that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) .  your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . .  $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . .  grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00  numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst  possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will  still make a lot of money !  remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in !

1343,"Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit  breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit ,  virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 ,  geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise ,  on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation .  the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data .  capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company .  in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 .  as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area .  a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market .  conclusion  development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream .  for additional information , visit  investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

"" so many times that  sensible people have learned to discount such claims .  but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is  doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will  believe it .  true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages  even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable  competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that  market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring  billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the  generators .  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable  competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of  generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis .  the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of  more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale  prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has  kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  *  short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought  to be lots of excess capacity .  as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the  state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is  a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly  whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for  other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and  such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced  outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a  view shared by a growing number of other researchers .  which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy  regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently  decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in  place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently ""  because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to  be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1  vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been  sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the  grounds that it would be ineffectual .  what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in  emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices  have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no  emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity  market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that  it is not .  second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes ,  offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt  laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one  reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for  example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring  states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin  borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds  that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at  the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive  to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we  never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they  will be pretty inefficient . ""  the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan .  there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  *  indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well  received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them .  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it ,  that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf  is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action  was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls  the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .  . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to  deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster .  whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the  administration have yet to offer california any significant  relief .  00 fo 04 b 3 blabf  visit nytimes . com for complete access to the  most authoritative news coverage on the web ,  updated throughout the day .  become a member today ! it ' s free !  http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta  how to advertise  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web , please contact alyson  racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media  kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo  for general information about nytimes . com , write to  help @ nytimes . com .  copyright 2001 the new york times company",0

"" it ' s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define  their roles differently , "" said ken weilerstein , an analyst at gartner group  inc . in stamford , conn . enron ' s plan also could help enterprise - level users  get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they ' re renting , such  as security and disaster recovery support , he added .  ravi thuraisingham , director of global bandwidth risk management at enron  broadband services , said the new offering won ' t include additional security  features . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and  bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities ,  he said .  initially , enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - -  expects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed  storage , depending on market conditions and the length of time a company  expects to need the capacity . "" we ' re there to try to discover a market  clearing price , "" said thuraisingham , adding that the service is tentatively  due to go online in the third quarter .  enron said it has already signed best buy co . , one of the leading retailers  of consumer electronics , computers and software in the u . s . , to buy the  storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management  application through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to  available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months ,  according to thuraisingham .  under enron ' s plan , storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be  connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company  currently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching  centers , or "" pooling points , "" in the u . s . , and another seven overseas .  at first , the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and  other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily  installed . but even there , thuraisingham said , enron is "" pretty much in the  initial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . ""  enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since  the spring of 1999 . later that year , it also launched a web site called  enrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas , electricity and other  commodities . that quickly became the world ' s largest e - commerce site and is  now said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily .  norman levine  enron broadband services  713 - 853 - 5010  norman _ levine @ enron . net",0

5036,"Subject: proj . x analytics diligence  paul ,  vince and i spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the  trading analytics . there is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a  two day time period . i think a reasonable start would be the following :  1 . obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been  implemented in order to verify profitability , and p / l volatility of each .  2 . review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare  these to projections for trading income .  3 . review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a  change of ownership would not have adverse consequences , i . e . are there  guarantees of continued access using the current systems ?  4 . review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets ? it is far from  clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the  current limited "" electronic "" liquidity .  5 . review , at least qualitatively , the current trading strategies being  used . try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these  strategies will disappear as other ' s implement similar trading models . what  is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage .  6 . review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will  be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and  outdated .  7 . try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading  technology to enron ' s other markets , given the illiquidity of these markets  as compared to the financial equity markets .  if there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis , we would  probably want to run their system on a test set of data .  let me know if you have other suggestions .  - - stinson",0

5104,"Subject: non - firm power curve building  hi vince ,  amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve to mark the non - firm position .  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk .  assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ? the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation . consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or group of units .  maybe i could get your thoughts later today .  thanks ,  vasant",0

5116,"Subject: p + option valuation model  mark ,  after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a - b - k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap ) - ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg "" b "" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "" b "" and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research",0

5128,"Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""  finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?  vasant",0

5230,"Subject: erisk interview  vince :  you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk . com last friday . were rick buy ' s comments about real options taken out of context ?  yann bonduelle leads a 25 - person team for in london  that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from  valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial  services business . here he talks to rob jameson about whether this "" theoretical ""  approach to risky decision - making really helps businesses in their day - to - day  balancing of risk and reward . yann holds a ph . d degree from the  engineering - economic systems department at stanford university , where he  studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic ,  social and business issues . he then worked as a consultant applying his decision  analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making  about innovative products such as electrical vehicles , before joining the   team in 1998 where he is now a partner . he has  written widely on the application of real options , particularly in fields of life  sciences , technology , and e - business , and has a special interest in the  relationship between risk assessment , validation of risk data and financial  valuation .  how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics ?  most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties  of some kind . decision analysis helps people explore problems , and redesign  their decision - making process to increase the chance of them making the right  choices . for example , imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide  whether to put itself up for sale , enter a strategic relationship , or continue to go it  alone . each of those options will lead on to other value - enhancing or  value - destroying scenarios . we work with the client firstly to understand and  challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business  development scenarios , and secondly to help them identify decisions that would  help protect or increase the value of their technology or company . quantifying  technical , regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge . in  technology - intensive fields , however , we have found that managers ( often  scientists ) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the  probability that a risky event may or may not occur .  how does this kind of risky decision - making relate to real options valuation ?  you can ' t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it  for . this means that , to form an opinion about the value of an asset , you must  explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have  a significant impact on the value of the asset . so decision analysis helps to define  the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter - related choices that are , in  effect , "" real options "" . for example , if a company is trying to decide whether to  invest in a risky project , does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment  at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing ? that "" real "" option reduces  the riskiness , and increases the potential value , of the original business plan . so  real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another . but you  don ' t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful .  what do you mean ?  often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic  decision , attach weights to these , and show clearly how they interact . for many  companies this "" risk discovery "" is the most valuable part of the exercise .  real options theory has been criticised recently for being , well , not very realistic .  is it a practical approach to valuation ?  it ' s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to  valuation . but it ' s an exciting methodology , and it ' s also sometimes the only  reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem . for example , when a firm  sells an asset , the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset  for legal or corporate governance reasons . but in many businesses today there  are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are  difficult to link to cashflows . the cashflows might not exist because the business  is so novel , or they might be hidden . in some respects , a real options analysis is  much closer to reality than a traditional valuation .  how , exactly ?  the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single  discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity . but this doesn ' t really take  account of the way that scenarios can change , or the fact that managers can  react to situations as they unfold . i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or  business at an early point . but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting  results , it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue - generating  position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows . so to value  a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a  number of scenarios . this is "" realistic "" in that , if the project gets the green light ,  you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all  of the time .  what ' s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree ?  modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree - - it ' s something we  have particular strengths in . but it ' s also tricky to know when it ' s worthwhile to  add on more detail , and when it ' s better to draw back .  in a recent erisk interview , rick buy , chief risk officer of enron , said that over  the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept , it had  found it of "" limited , but not zero , use "" . why is there a slight air of cynicism about  real options in some businesses today ?  it ' s strange that enron would profess this attitude . a few years ago , it was widely  reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase  decision . they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us  that generated electricity at a very high cost . they knew that they could mothball  them for most of the year , and switch them on only when the electricity prices  were sufficiently high . nevertheless , from a customer ' s point of view , there might  have been too much hype about the methodology . one problem in the application  of real options technology is that there are , perhaps , too many people trying to  tweak reality to conform to their "" perfect "" model . it ' s better to aim for something  pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time . in one pharmaceutical  company we worked with recently , we worked together to improve their valuation  analyses by moving from a single discounted cash - flow methodology to one that  took into account a rather small set of business scenarios . it would have shocked  some academics and consultants , but it was an undeniable improvement on the  original approach .  why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field , when  it ' s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more ?  it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until  recently , and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed . also ,  industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an  engineering and science background . the dynamic modelling of decisions is  based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical  and electronic systems . this approach is quite distinct from the black - scholes  options analyses that the banking world is familiar with : the black - scholes  approach is difficult to apply in a real options context , because everything  depends on the assumptions that you put into the black - scholes model . the real  options approach , on the other hand , is in a sense a way of modelling those  assumptions more explicitly . but banks are now adopting some of the thinking ,  particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify  value - enhancing decisions , and in using real options methodologies to sort the  wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments .  you mean their internet investments ?  we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the  internet game , and then made a considerable number of investments . now that  even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them , and many  b 2 c businesses are already under water , they wanted to work out which  investments might contain real value . in this situation , it ' s a case of ranking  priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a  decision - making chaos , rather than sophisticated valuation . it ' s not just a case of  whether an internet investment should be killed off , but the problem of whether  continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it  upgrades in existing businesses , and so on . these are very practical questions  and they have to be answered somehow .  are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this  approach ?  yes , for example , we think it can help work out the value associated with various  approaches to marketing a new bank business line . at the moment , many banks  are chasing high - net - worth individuals , but it ' s not always clear which kind of  individual a particular bank should decide to pursue . the bank might have a  regional or industry advantage already in one particular area , for example , music  business people . but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of  customer ? what is the profitability associated with the customer segment ? will  the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh  any disadvantages ? weighing up this kind of complex problem , where one thing  leads to and depends on another , is what decision and real options analysis is  good at .  is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations ?  in all honesty , not really . the problem is that by the time the option is exercised ,  many of the variables surrounding it will have changed , so it ' s difficult to compare  our original analysis with how things turn out . however , the value of the analysis  comes not only from the final number ( "" the value of this asset is x "" ) but also from  providing a thorough process , an outsider ' s point of view , an understanding of the  sources of value and , in short , a bit of clearer thinking .  if real options are so important , why are they so rarely cited in communications to  shareholders and equity analysts ?  the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a  significant part of their internal analysis . even in major companies in the oil & gas ,  and pharmaceutical sectors , where the ideas have taken some root internally ,  there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication . we  are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move  things on to the next step .  how does the riskiness of a business , in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it  faces , relate to its share value , and its capital structure ?  that ' s a big question . it ' s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal  debt - to - equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation , which in turn arises  out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business . the more volatile the  business , the less gearing it can sustain , and the higher the cost of capital . our  work touches on this in the sense that exercising ( many ) specific real options can  allow a firm to change its nature , and thus also its risk profile . one classic  example is the pharmaceutical industry . a host of different kinds of companies  service that industry from "" big pharma "" companies through to smaller  biotechnology startups and run - of - the - mill contract research organisations . a  contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive  environment with relatively few risks - - it does not invest in drug development itself  - - but also very thin margins . but in fact , a few of these companies have used the  skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and  profitable healthcare companies of various kinds . it ' s an example of a company  exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own  identity .  rob jameson , erisk",0

 a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay  obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate  countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .  furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only  one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market  status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another  member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to  call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the  european union .  * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are  financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in  various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have  been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .  this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of  imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks  that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but  the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1  indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected  to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself  cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries  that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry  to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .  * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission  companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of  liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is  all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .  in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal  separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate  countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .  table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the  table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very  recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the  directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries  scheduled for the first wave .  * * end * *  follow above url for full report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 !

5249,"Subject: ebs ' s approach to storage trading  hi ravi - -  thanks for you note . i would be very interested in a meeting to establish an  ebs - wide approach to storage . it ' s a huge opportunity .  we could expand the 2 : 30 pm friday meeting to include all interested ebs  people and discuss the topics below . could shalesh coordinate this meeting  and also coordinate the ongoing effort firm - wide ? have i omitted anything  below ?  as i see it , here are the key storage initiatives that ebs should undertake ,  and who is involved up to this point .  1 . - establish storage contract terms and pricing  who ' s involved : virawan , jean mrha beach  a . define terms for storage needed for ebs products ( mediacast ,  mediatransport , and new products )  b . define general terms for other storage contracts  2 . - establish storage pooling points ( spp )  who ' s involved : shalesh , richard reichardt , mark palmer , kara knop  who ' s needed : other designated people from bloomer and griebling groups , jim  crowder ' s group input on alliances  a . define technology needed  servers , storage devices  control software for physical delivery  b . decide optimal spp locations  at / near existing bandwidth trading pooling points  at / near existing ebs city pops  at a hosting partner location  c . engage optimal partners to create spp  ibm  ibm global services  tivioli ( storage management software )  emc  sun  compaq  existing storage portal vendors ( e . g . storage networks )  3 . - establish storage trading benchmark  who ' s involved : unknown  who ' s needed : research group  a . define unit of measure for trading contract ( e . g . , terabyte - month )  b . establish pricing mechanisms  4 . - identify ( and monetize ) storage market opportunites  who ' s involved : unknown  who ' s needed : cox ' s group , bloomer ' s group  a . storage intermediation opportunities  b . establish virtual storage portal service for ebs  ravi thuraisingham  03 / 08 / 00 11 : 00 am  to : mark s palmer / enron communications @ enron communications , jean mrha / enron  communications @ enron communications , john bloomer / enron communications @ enron  communications , richard reichardt / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : kara knop , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince kaminski , david cox / enron  communications @ enron communications , shalesh . ganjoo @ enron . com  subject : meeting for friday on storage  hi mark , i have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you . i  would like to discuss with you and possibly with john bloomer and richard  reichardt about the ebs research ' s role in supporting the storage market  development from the origination and trading perspective . there are several  people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what ' s my  take on our involvement - - please correct me or suggest otherwise .  shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort  with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and  standardization for a traded storage maret - - stinson gibner is directly  supervising him in this effort .  shalesh came to us through referal from david cox - - david discovered him at  one of his speaking engagements . shalesh had talked to david about traded  storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh  to enron research group . we hired shalesh for general analyst position and  now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort . currently , he is  our point person ( with stinson or i supervising his effort ) who is supporting  jean mrha and you on the subject . kara knop has aproached shalesh with  request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other  , s  role in this regard . as per my discussion today with david , we need to  coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market  assessment etc . for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties  involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source . based  on david ' s and my assessment of shalesh ' s capabilities , i would like to  suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking ,  understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data  gathering and simple research effort . we can add other staff as we see the  need and as you request them .  please respond this e - mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan , so  that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner .  kind regards ,  ravi .  a bit about ebs research group  john bloomer and richard reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and  stinston gibner ' s role in ebs . i lead a team of quantitative professionals  via a group we are calling ebs research . this group reports to stinson  gibner ( vp ) and vince kaminski ( md and head of enron research ) . stinson and  vince are the original founders of enron corp research that has been charged  with model development efforts to support enron energy trading and other  enron business . enron research is involved in all aspects of enron buinesses  ( ees , international , corporate affairs such as fas 133 and other accounting  and new product ( derivatives ) development , etc . ) .  within ebs research , there serveral professionals supporting kevin howard  ( cfo office ) , john griebling , tom gros and jean mrha , david cox ( via boris ) ,  and the war room . our main area of focus is with jean mrha ( trading ) and  john griebling ( optical network design and optimization , etc . ) . we play a  key role with john griebling ' s go forward network design and implementation  through our responsiblity to provide traffic engineering analysis and  modeling effort .  -

5252,"Subject: steve leppard  hi vince ,  hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement . they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we ' re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research .  i ' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron . there are several things i see we can do :  1 ) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market . i ' m not  sure this is the best way to go , especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase .  2 ) offer him more responsibility : what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team ? with my move to  ebs , should we accelerate this ? i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated , and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year - end ( as part of the regular process ) that takes into account his greater  responsibility .  3 ) we have some people that we ' re trying to get under long - term ( 3 - yr )  contract with a 12 - month notice clause . obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed .  we ' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london , and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job .  i ' d value your thoughts on this .  thanks ,  dale",0

5270,"Subject: re :  joe ,  i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston  for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use .  vince  joseph hrgovcic  08 / 01 / 2000 06 : 51 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , mike a roberts / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject :  vince ,  i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long  term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than  the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and  that they are an "" old boy ' s network "" resistant to new developments , but i  don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as  the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented  phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or  so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something  even close to that will not be an easy task .  that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look  into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm  traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures ,  i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put  together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian  has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several  dozens of "" possible "" temperature forecasts every morning , which would be  calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i  would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a  far better "" best guess "" ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a  distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses :  1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a  more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that  with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations )  2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to  week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps )  3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts ,  e . g . , "" expect the trough to recede "" we could sort through the different monte  carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and  use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures  corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of  getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean  temperature - wise  4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such  models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the  traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly  match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ;  although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating  month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the  visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations .  just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has  written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who  worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a  simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version  of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to  implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the  technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather  consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily  ( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running .  they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs  on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor .  i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not  sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of  enron , and not just the weather desk .  i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the  opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with  christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more  likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian  model ) .  joe",0

5306,"Subject: the lure of the san  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  03 / 14 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e - business is changing how businesses value information . information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,  information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial .  companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they  often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models .  today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other  application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .  this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because  the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .  third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,  because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files .  this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .  sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,  centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to  remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back - up operations .  using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -  performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices  can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .  yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still  developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs .  given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  -

"" if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0

( this could  possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -  ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him  working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .  i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m  not sure of this .  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are  useful to us are :  probability / statistical model development  development of theoretical pricing methodology  excellent computer programming skills  database development and data analysis  he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of  mike curley , the nerc data manager .  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products  for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to  hedging insurance portfolios .  if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .  can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real  tank through a minefield ) .  one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with  the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him  confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in  the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job  in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the  office for that , so we can do that next week .  please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up  but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .  thanks ,  - - dave",0

 c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0

5486,"Subject: organizational changes  we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined  ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will  focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term  attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to  the ebs office of the chairman .  jim bannantine , currently co -

5506,"Subject: alp proposal  carrie ,  i am sending you , as promised , the draft of my proposal . please , let me know  if it meets your requirements . i shall be glad to revise it and send you the  final version .  vince kaminski  * * * * * * * * * *  one of the most important trends in the energy industry during the last year  was proliferation of electronic , internet based , trading platforms for  wholesale markets and for retail operations . websites such as  www . houstonstreet . com and www . altranet . com provide facilities for matching  buyers and sellers . the website operated by enron corp . ( enrononline )  represents an alternative solution under which enron acts as a principal in  every transaction . on the retail ? side , many retail e - commerce companies  offering auctions , reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers  ,  clubs challenge incumbent utilities . the objective of this project is to  evaluate the impact of e - commerce ( both at the wholesale and retail levels )  on the energy industry . the study will start with comparative analysis of  different wholesale trading and retail e - commerce business models and  evaluation of their long - term viability . the next step will be assessment of  the impact of e - commerce on price dynamics , profit margins and the level of  competition in different energy markets . a separate section will be devoted  to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e - commerce  ( incumbent utilities , organized exchanges , energy brokers ) to the new  competitive threat , and different strategies they implement to meet the  challenge . organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition  to screen - based trading that has been already replacing open outcry  technology . power and natural gas marketers have created alliances ( with  other industry players , software companies and electronic exchanges ) to  create their own trading platforms . gas and electric utilities embarked on  development of vertical and horizontal e - commerce platforms , offering  services to households and other companies in the energy industry . the  critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the  competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by  the internet based economy . it ' s quite obvious that the internet revolution  will change the energy industry ' s landscape during the next few years . the  objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above ,  based on the currently available information . additionally , the participants  should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement  in case the currently ? expected trends fail to materialize .   _",0

5559,"Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise  chonawee ,  as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .  suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .  you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to  $ 100 .  you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise  gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes  on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is  28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against  ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .  of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset .  the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have  income in the  future ( or capital gains ) .  not so good .  by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem .  vince  chonawee supatgiat @ enron  07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : short - sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position .",0

5576,"Subject: stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an  "" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0

5648,"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

5718,"Subject: altos na gas model  kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term  natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that  the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america  should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,  in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .  pipeline grid .  as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale  nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and  one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed  that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and  testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the  software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the  one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription  price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other  details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still  need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to  proceed with the test .  with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be  responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is  pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in  ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key  role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately  be made by the new project team .  i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it  has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the  "" affiliate "" issues ) .  let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .  jng",0
